I'm sorry, mr. Bing. There's no record of your reservation in the computer. Well, that's impossible. Can you check again? Please check again, please

0:00:08.590 --> 0:00:11.249
I'm sorry. It's not here not there

0:00:12.700 --> 0:00:15.330
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday

0:00:15.330 --> 0:00:20.490
I try to cancel my reservation was told it's not refundable then we drove six hours all the way up here

0:00:20.490 --> 0:00:24.600
And now you're telling me that we don't have a reservation. I don't know what to say that

0:00:26.199 --> 0:00:28.199
Just give us the cheapest room you have

0:00:28.779 --> 0:00:33.718
Unfortunately, the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite the rate is $600. That's insane

0:00:34.390 --> 0:00:36.750
Totally insane dude. Let's drive home

0:00:36.750 --> 0:00:43.439
We'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if they're closed and maybe we'll tap the tree and make some ourselves

0:00:45.760 --> 0:00:48.390
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in

0:00:50.440 --> 0:00:52.469
We'll take it great

0:00:53.949 --> 0:00:58.409
They are totally ripping us off dude. Don't worry about it. I know how we can make your money back

0:00:58.570 --> 0:01:05.519
This is a nice hotel, you know plenty of amenities. We just load up on those like those apples instead of taking one

0:01:05.519 --> 0:01:07.519
um, I pick six

0:01:08.830 --> 0:01:11.189
Great at $100 an Apple we're there

0:01:12.970 --> 0:01:16.739
Well, you get the idea, you know, we'll make our money back in no time

0:01:17.259 --> 0:01:20.729
Dude, you're shaking. I think it's the sugar. Could you hold the Apple?

0:01:27.890 --> 0:01:33.549
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206, um, I seem to have forgotten a couple of things good

0:01:33.549 --> 0:01:36.519
Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?

0:01:37.909 --> 0:01:39.909

0:01:40.189 --> 0:01:46.479
Toothbrush toothpaste razor mouthwash deodorant dental floss band-aids shaving cream aftershave

0:01:47.990 --> 0:01:53.289
And I feel like I'm forgetting something um, is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already

0:01:55.610 --> 0:01:57.610
Go ahead set up some tampons

0:02:00.890 --> 0:02:02.890

0:02:12.590 --> 0:02:15.099
Feel so alive I love being in the country

0:02:16.459 --> 0:02:20.469
So I've got these great salt and pepper shakers from the restaurant. That's not cool

0:02:22.160 --> 0:02:24.160
Dude none of this is cool

0:02:25.940 --> 0:02:31.569
Chandler you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you

0:02:32.030 --> 0:02:37.209
For example a hair dryer. No, no, no, but shampoos and conditioners are yes. Yes

0:02:39.109 --> 0:02:45.489
Now the the salt shaker is off-limits but the salt I

0:02:47.000 --> 0:02:49.000
Wish I'd thought this through

0:02:49.730 --> 0:02:55.030
Think again. We mean Oh like the lamp is is the hotel's but the bulbs

0:02:55.819 --> 0:02:59.499
Are you already got that not my first time in a hotel my friend?

0:03:00.590 --> 0:03:06.970
Okay, how about this? No. No, you can't take the remote control. Yes, but the batteries

0:03:12.980 --> 0:03:17.470
Thank you, thank you very much let's let's celebrate with some maple king no

0:03:19.579 --> 0:03:21.579

0:03:33.910 --> 0:03:40.589

0:03:42.130 --> 0:03:44.130

0:03:44.590 --> 0:03:46.590
There's there's something new in the bowl

0:03:47.410 --> 0:03:51.839
